You are building an app called RCMD. RCMD is short for "Recommendation".
The purpose is to allow users to curate an inventory of recommendations, links to share with others, but also has page building functionality by allowing the user to add different types of content blocks.
RCMDs have their own public shareable pages.
Users can also add additional shareable pages to their profile and populate them with blocks, assigning one of them to be the default.

Important: please use bun for package management (never npm or yarn)

When carrying out tasks related to the following platforms, please always try using an MCP function before other approaches:
- Vercel
- Supabase
- Sanity

Other notes:
- Use Supabase MCP to apply migrations rather than asking me to do so.
- The prompt "fbe" means "run `bun run build` and fix build errors"
- Remember to use modern Next.js syntax where `params` should be awaited before using its properties E.g. code like
`const { handle } = params;`
Should actually be:
`const resolvedParams = await params; const { handle } = resolvedParams;`
- Always prefix debug or trace statments with "[DEBUG]" so we can easily find and remove them later.
